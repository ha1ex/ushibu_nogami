# Multi-provider parallel deep-research aggregator with cross-reference synthesis

> Problem solved: Any single deep-research provider has blind spots — Gemini misses what OpenAI catches, Perplexity surfaces what Parallel doesn't. Fan the same query out to four providers in parallel, then run a synthesis pass that surfaces consensus, unique findings, and contradictions. Reported uplift: +120% findings vs the best single provider on an ICP study.

## What

Send one research question to **four deep-research providers in parallel** — Gemini Deep Research, OpenAI Deep Research, Perplexity, and Parallel.ai — then run a cross-reference synthesis step (a Claude skill) that tags each finding as `consensus` (2+ providers agree), `unique` (one provider only), or `contradiction` (providers disagree). Contradictions and uniques get a targeted secondary research pass to decide what to keep. Consensus findings ship into the final report; verified contradictions get flagged with confidence levels. Parallel.ai's structured JSON output makes it the right pick for programmatic agent use; Gemini's browser-mode DR is best for human-driven multidisciplinary reviews. NotebookLM is the working synthesis surface when the question stays open across multiple sessions.

## Why it matters

Reported numbers from operators running this:

- One ICP study for AI consulting work, 4 variant prompts × 4 providers = 16 reports → synthesis produced **32 consensus + 30 unique + 4 contradictions = 66 total findings** vs an average of ~30 findings per single provider. That's **+120% findings vs the best single provider**.
- Parallel's Ultra 8x mode reads **~50k pages in 30–50 minutes** on a single hard run; an operator running 6–8 parallel Ultra researches brackets a topic in an evening.
- Cursor productized the underlying primitive (ask two models the same question, compare) into a public two-model UX in May 2026, validating that the pattern works at consumer scale.

## End-to-end

1. **Define the research question and 4 variant prompts.** Variants reduce single-prompt brittleness. Keep them concrete: same target topic, different angles ("competitive landscape", "customer pains", "regulatory exposure", "channel economics").
2. **Send each variant to each provider.** 16 reports total in the reference workflow. Use the providers' native deep-research surfaces — they each have their own pacing, retry logic, and citation style.
3. **Drop the raw reports into a synthesis surface.** Two paths: (a) a Claude Code skill that reads all 16 reports and emits a structured synthesis; (b) NotebookLM as the conversational surface where you keep asking follow-up questions across the corpus. Source uses both depending on whether the deliverable is a one-shot report or a live research thread.
4. **Run the synthesis prompt.** It tags each finding with `consensus` / `unique` / `contradiction` and writes a structured output. The synthesis is where the value lives — *not* in the individual reports. Each provider has blind spots that only show up in comparison.
5. **Secondary research on contradictions and uniques.** Don't ship a contradiction; resolve it with a targeted follow-up. Source warns: contradictions are where each provider is most confident-wrong; do *not* default to majority vote.
6. **For deep technical topics, use Parallel Ultra 8x.** Source operator's example: scanning the full Confidential Computing literature to validate his own architecture, ~50k pages digested in <1 hour per Ultra run; output dumped into NotebookLM for continued conversation.
7. **For programmatic / agent-driven research, lean on Parallel.** Its JSON output integrates cleanly with downstream agents; GPT and Gemini DR output is markdown-shaped and needs additional parsing for agent pipelines.

## Prompts

Synthesis prompt for the Claude skill that reads N reports and emits a categorized output:

```
`You are reading N deep-research reports on the same question, from
different providers. Your job is to produce ONE synthesis with three
sections:

1. CONSENSUS findings — claims supported by 2+ reports. Cite which.
2. UNIQUE findings — claims appearing in only one report. List with
 the source provider and a one-line note on whether the claim is
 verifiable from the report's own citations.
3. CONTRADICTIONS — claims where reports disagree directly. List each
 with the conflicting positions and the providers holding each.

Do not invent. If a provider made a claim and others didn't address
it, that's UNIQUE, not contradiction. If reports approach the same
question from incompatible framings, surface that as a meta-note at
the end — not as a contradiction.
`
```

Field-tested deep-research provider mix:

```
`Parallel.ai — best for programmatic / JSON output; Ultra 8x for hard topics
Gemini DR — best for human-driven multidisciplinary research (browser)
OpenAI DR — strong on synthesis; markdown output
Perplexity — fast; good for grounding short-cycle questions
NotebookLM — synthesis surface for cross-session research threads
`
```

## Gotchas

- **Don't trust majority vote on contradictions.** Source explicitly warns: contradictions are where each provider is most confident-wrong. Resolve them with targeted follow-up, not by tallying.
- **The synthesis is the deliverable, not the raw reports.** Operator: *"Synthesis is where the value lives. Each provider has blind spots on its own output."*
- **Parallel's JSON output is the differentiator for agents.** GPT / Gemini DR markdown needs parsing before agent integration; if you're piping into a downstream agent, Parallel is the right surface.
- **Cost compounds fast on Ultra 8x.** One operator reports a $17/run economic anchor on Gemini Search Grounding via Vertex service-account; Parallel Ultra 8x is in a similar class. Budget per question, not per session.
- **NotebookLM is a conversational surface, not a synthesis API.** For one-shot synthesis, run the Claude skill against the reports; for an ongoing research thread, drop them into NotebookLM and converse with it.
