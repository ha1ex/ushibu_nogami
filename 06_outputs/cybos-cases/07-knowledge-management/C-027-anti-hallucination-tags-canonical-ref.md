# Anti-hallucination tags `[CANONICAL]` / `[REF:]`

> "Where did this fact come from?" has no answer six weeks later. Every statement is either canonical or a pointer; traceable provenance always.

## What

Every statement in the vault is either `[CANONICAL]` (the first declaration of a fact) or `[REF: folder/file.md#section]` (a pointer to the canonical version). Inline tags inside files give the agent traceable provenance for every claim it surfaces.
