# OpenClaw — personal autonomous agent on a server (Telegram + skills + cron)

> None

## What

OpenClaw is a public agent harness packaged so a non-DevOps operator can install one on a server with a single bash one-liner, connect it to Telegram, give it Gmail / Drive / 1Password / browser-automation scopes, and let it act as a 24/7 personal assistant. The community shipped real, varied workloads on it during six months of testimony: nightly self-research with morning Telegram briefings; daily 6-minute auto-generated podcasts about AI agent news; DoorDash water reordering via voice + a 1Password shared vault; parking-ticket payment via browser automation; California sales-tax filing; insurance-form photo parsing + auto-submit; a habit-coaching loop with spaced repetition and gamified badges. Around the harness an entire ecosystem grew: productized one-click deployers, multi-tenant family fleets where each person gets their own isolated VM, Ada-on-a-personal-Telegram-account variants, and a 16-agent factory pipeline shipping new apps end-to-end. OpenClaw is also the canonical reference deployment for the defense-in-depth playbook in.

## Why it matters

Reported outcomes across six months of group operator testimony:

- One operator stood up a personal nightly research bot on Hetzner; "context delegation" replaces ~30-60 minutes of daily news scanning across AI agent ecosystems.
- A daily 6-minute auto-generated podcast about AI news shipped via cron and built a public distribution channel without any human intervention after the initial setup.
- Solo founders converged on subscription-token authentication (Claude Pro/Max) instead of API billing — one operator burned $90 of API in a single day before switching to a flat $200/mo subscription. Same pattern for Codex.
- A 16-agent factory pipeline (research → ICP/stack/PRD → isolated GCP project → 6-10 parallel Claude Code agents on feature branches → orchestrator merge → Chrome MCP E2E → Cloud Run deploy → traffic test → unit economics check) shipped its first end-to-end app in 24 hours, rated 7/10 by its operator; subsequent apps inherited skills learned on the previous one. The same harness underpins this factory + a daily-news bot + the 5-layer defense playbook — that's the umbrella shape.
- A productized variant for non-technical users provisions a fully-isolated client VM with OpenClaw + a curated skill pack (email, task tracker, CRM, reels-maker, SMM manager) in roughly 6 minutes from sign-up. The community contains at least five independently-shipped one-click deployer products built on top of the same OpenClaw core.

The harness moved the median operator from "AI is a tool I open" to "an agent runs on my behalf while I sleep."

## End-to-end

**A. Install + deploy core**

1. **Pick a target.** OpenClaw runs on a single Linux VM, a Mac mini, a Raspberry Pi 5, or a Mac Studio. See the deployment-target table below — choice is a function of always-on need, residential-IP requirements, RAM ceiling for local models, and personal preference for tangible-vs-cloud.
2. **One-line install.** The community-shipped install pattern is a curl-bash one-liner that pulls the harness + skill bundle + onboarding wizard. The deployment pattern (curl-pipe-bash one-liner orchestrated by the harness installer) is the operational signature; the exact URL is the harness vendor's. Operators routinely describe this as turning Telegram into "an app-store-for-agents": one bash line installs an agent + all its skills.
3. **Authenticate via subscription token, not API billing.** Run `claude setup-token` locally — opens browser, prints a Claude Pro/Max OAuth token. Paste into the OpenClaw onboarding wizard. The bot now uses your subscription quota instead of per-token API rates. Codex has an analogous setup-token model. **Important caveat:** Anthropic's TOS explicitly bans automation through consumer subscription tokens, with bans beginning January 9, 2026. Treat subscription-token mode as manual-only / experimental; use real API billing for any production-grade deployment.
4. **Configure secrets via env-vars, never literal in JSON.** See step 1 — `${ENV_VAR}` references in `openclaw.json`, actual secrets in `~/.openclaw/.env` (`chmod 600`), loaded via systemd EnvironmentFile.
5. **Apply the 5-layer defense before adding tools.** OS isolation + exec sandbox + DLP + blast-radius scoping before you give the bot Gmail / Drive / shell. The order matters: every operator who hardened after adding tools reports finding holes the hard way.
6. **Connect the messenger.** Telegram bot token first (it's the simplest). WhatsApp via the mirror QR trick (point phone at mirror, scan the inverted QR) on operator-reported workarounds. Slack via the published integration. Set `allowFrom` to your own Telegram ID only for owner-DM channel.
7. **Add channels: Gmail / Drive / 1Password / browser.** Drop credentials into a 1Password shared vault and connect via the 1Password CLI rather than storing in config — the bot fetches secrets at call time, with tmux session caching so the operator isn't re-prompted on every login. Browser automation via Playwright / Chromium, or the heavyweight Xvfb + Fluxbox + Chrome + x11vnc + noVNC stack for visible browser sessions you can VNC into.
8. **Schedule the first cron.** Tell OpenClaw in natural language: "I want to read news about X every morning." The bot proactively configures the web/X search skill, formatter, cron job, and writes results to a markdown file in a dedicated Obsidian vault folder where it has write access (other folders read-only — that's the security boundary). Optional: TTS the digest so you can listen on the drive.

**B. Deployment-target catalog**

<table><thead><tr><th>Target</th><th>Best for</th><th>Cost shape</th><th>Watch out for</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**Hetzner / cloud VPS**</td><td>24/7 always-on, full automation, low cost. Most operators' default.</td><td>~$5-25/mo per VM; one operator's productized variant uses ~$45 for 2GB/2vCPU/1GB disk + $15 model credit.</td><td>Datacenter IP gets blocked by YouTube and some scrapers — see RPi-at-home trick in C-block below.</td></tr><tr><td>**Mac mini**</td><td>"Tangible" personal compute, residential IP, dedicated, no shared-infra rate limits.</td><td>One-time hardware; no monthly cost.</td><td>Requires home networking competence; not portable; not redundant.</td></tr><tr><td>**Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)**</td><td>Lowest-power always-on at home; passive cooler, silent.</td><td>One-time kit cost.</td><td>RAM/CPU ceiling — phi-4-mini local model fallback tested but too slow for primary use; works for harness + remote model only.</td></tr><tr><td>**Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB**</td><td>Local frontier-class open-weight models (GPT-OSS 120B, Qwen3-235B-A22B, Kimi K2.5) for privacy-sensitive workloads — no data leaves the box.</td><td>Large one-time hardware (~$50k class).</td><td>Wait for the next refresh if you can; memory bandwidth matters more than raw GB. M5 reportedly worth the wait per one operator's reading.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Cross-cutting recommendation: for any agent with persistent permissions (read your email, write your Drive, run your shell), prefer cloud over Mac mini. The Mac mini is "tangible" but the cloud VM is auditable, snap-shottable, and disposable. One operator's blunt frame: "the Mac mini purchase is emotional, not technical, for serious always-on agents."

**C. Operational primitives**

1. **1Password CLI integration for passwords + sudo.** Instead of storing passwords in bot config, OpenClaw calls 1Password CLI when login is needed. Shared vault holds DoorDash, Stripe, the works. Use tmux session caching for the 1Password auth so you're not re-prompted on every API call. (Pattern transferable to LastPass / other vaults with CLIs.)
2. **Message-hooks patch for guaranteed logging + DLP + memory.** Apply the community message-hooks patch to the harness (telegram.ts gains `message:received` / `message:sent` events). Layer on (a) raw jsonl logging at `raw/telegram/chats/<chat_id>/<year>/<month>/<day>.jsonl`, (b) DLP scan on outbound, (c) bot-to-bot arena via a shared GitHub repo as distributed log, (d) the three-layer memory architecture (raw → embeddings → goal-biased retrieval — see the related Tier A case on three-layer agent memory).
3. **Nightly research + reflection cron.** Cron at ~3 am: deep-research on (your ecosystem + the bot's own behavior + planned roadmap), produce structured TL;DR with sources / action items / costs / "what went wrong" / next-run improvements, deliver to owner Telegram in the morning. Low-risk patches (config edits, allowlist updates) get applied autonomously; high-risk surfaced for approval.
4. **Self-installing skills via natural language.** Tell the bot what you want — "order water" / "pay parking ticket" / "read news every morning" — and it proactively configures the search skill, the formatter, the cron job, and the output destination. The discipline is to scope the skill catalog to ~10 files of context per major capability so the agent doesn't drown.
5. **Residential-IP bypass for scrapers.** Stick a Raspberry Pi on your home network, run a WireGuard server on it, tunnel the cloud bot's browser traffic through your home IP. Datacenter IPs get blocked by YouTube and many social platforms; the home RPi gets through.
6. **Visible browser sessions when Playwright fails.** When Playwright's stability isn't enough, deploy Xvfb (virtual display) + Fluxbox (WM) + Chrome + x11vnc + noVNC on the VPS, then SSH-tunnel port 6080 to your laptop and watch the bot drive a real Chrome at `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`. Bot controls mouse/keyboard via xdotool and captures screens with scrot.

**D. Productized-deployer variants (ecosystem)**

A market of one-click OpenClaw deployers shipped during this period. Without naming specific single-source brands, the productized-deployer pattern looks like this:

- A Telegram-bot deployer that takes payment in Telegram Stars or USD, provisions a Hetzner/DO VM, runs the OpenClaw install one-liner, applies the 5-layer security defaults, and hands the user a Telegram-bot token. End-to-end ~10 minutes.
- A managed-OpenClaw-for-non-technical-users variant where a 7-day trial spins up a pre-configured e2-medium GCP VM in ~6 minutes with a curated skill pack (email / task tracker / CRM / reels-maker / SMM manager). Guardian VM monitors and auto-respawns failed clones (deterministic logic for known faults) + a dedicated remediation OpenClaw agent for novel issues. `sudo` disabled on client machines for safety.
- An "OpenClaw deploy in a box" service with security defaults baked in (the same shape with a heavier security emphasis).
- A bring-your-own-model fork popular with the local-models community that supports plugging in any model including on-device Mac Studio inference.
- A multi-tenant family fleet pattern: each family member gets their own isolated VM running OpenClaw; agents share a single git repo for skill exchange + dedicated GCS bucket for file exchange + can message each other via a shared chat.

The lesson from the ecosystem is structural, not brand-specific: OpenClaw's one-line install + clean skill format created enough surface area for many independent productizations to ship in parallel. Operators choosing between them weight on security defaults, supported deploy targets, model lock-in vs BYO, and price.

**E. Operational scale + self-healing**

1. **16-agent factory shape.** The most-cited scale point: 16 specialized agents organized in 3 tiers — (1) a heavyweight orchestrator (Paperclip-class) for async multi-day work, (2) Claude/Codex built-in Agent Teams for cross-system features, (3) a Claude orchestrator session in a terminal with 1M context as the human's helicopter view. Each agent has a small focused skill catalog (~10 files of context). 4-6 in parallel sustained; ceiling around 6 due to operator context-switching cost. (See for the parallel-agent dev workflow this depends on.)
2. **Self-healing fleet pattern.** A dedicated "Guardian" OpenClaw agent watches every client VM. Deterministic remediation handles known failure modes; novel issues get handed to a remediation agent with all relevant skills and creds, which SSHes in autonomously and fixes. Skills learned during resolution get persisted back to the skill bundle. Public writeups document the architecture at the operator level.
3. **Ada-on-a-personal-account variant.** Run OpenClaw on a separate regular (non-bot) Telegram account so the agent participates in human work chats as a peer rather than a tool. Personality + avatar generated by feeding Claude Code the operator's emails. Drafts to others route through a separate bot for human approval before sending. Can take voice calls via Telegram. Useful when you want the agent visible to colleagues; not useful (and arguably misleading) where social context matters.

## Prompts

Subscription-token authentication:

```
`# On local machine, NOT on the server:
claude setup-token
# browser opens for Claude OAuth → token printed in terminal
# paste token into OpenClaw onboarding wizard
# bot now uses subscription quota, not API billing
`
```

Natural-language skill installation — the operational signature:

```
`> I want to read news about <topic> every morning

— bot proactively configures: web/X search skill, formatter, cron job
— bot writes daily output as markdown into a dedicated Obsidian folder
— other vault folders are read-only — security boundary
— optional: ask the bot to TTS the digest into audio messages
`
```

Deployment-target decision rule (post on the wall next to your terminal):

```
`24/7, low cost, full automation → cloud VPS (Hetzner / GCP e2-medium minimum for WhatsApp)
home, residential IP, dedicated → Mac mini (one-time hardware, no rate limits)
low-power always-on, learning project → Raspberry Pi 5 (harness + remote model only)
local frontier-class private inference → Mac Studio (M3 Ultra 512GB; M5 worth the wait if not urgent)

Cross-cut: any agent with persistent secrets → prefer cloud. Mac mini is tangible but
not auditable / snapshottable / disposable in the same way.
`
```

## Gotchas

- **Don't run subscription-token mode in production.** Anthropic's TOS explicitly bans automation through consumer subscription tokens; bans began January 9, 2026. Setup-token mode is for manual / experimental use. Codex's analogous mode appears more tolerant but the same risk profile applies. Use real API billing for anything you depend on.
- **Don't host an agent with persistent permissions on your laptop.** Cloud-host it. The persistently-running agent with auth needs to outlive any single device session.
- **Skills require explicit refresh in the main `claude.md`.** Migrating from a monolithic `claude.md` to a skill-based layout drops output quality because skill changes don't auto-propagate. Add an explicit rule to the main `claude.md` that requires re-read of skills.
- **WhatsApp needs at least an e2-medium VM tier.** WhatsApp channel needs more RAM than Telegram. After six failed PR-fix iterations on one operator's bot, root cause was an undersized VM (e2-small). Set e2-medium as your minimum for any client machine that needs WhatsApp.
- **Don't structure agents along the human org chart.** Subsystem-boundary slicing (auth, billing, ingestion, etc.) is what works at scale; CEO → GM → Tech-Lead multi-agent setups burn tokens on routing chatter without merging code. See for the dev workflow.
- **Don't exceed your personal parallel ceiling.** Operators report ceilings between 3-4 and 6 simultaneous agents. Beyond that, context-switching cost wipes out the throughput gain.
- **Don't reinvent the productized deployers.** If you don't need to customize the install path, install one of the shipped deployers and put your engineering effort into skills + your own data integrations. The deployer market exists because the install pattern is well-trodden.
- **Apify alone isn't enough for full X coverage.** One operator supplemented Apify with xAI direct API access for complete Twitter/X search. Plan for the dual-source pattern if X is in your research mix.
- **Self-installed skills can be malicious.** ~340 malicious skills shipped to one community index in early 2026. Apply the skill-vetting pipeline from step 7 (deep-audit → isolated container → outbound monitor → install) before adding any community skill to a production bot.
- **The morning briefing is the wow moment but it's not the value.** The value is the agent acquiring durable institutional memory + the ability to act on it. The cron + Telegram briefing is the demoable signature; the three-layer memory architecture ( ) + the 5-layer defense ( ) + the install pattern (this case) are what make it sustainable.
