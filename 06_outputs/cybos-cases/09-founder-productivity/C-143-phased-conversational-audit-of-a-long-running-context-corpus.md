# Phased conversational audit of a long-running context corpus

> Problem solved: Founder context files (mission / goals / principles) decay silently; a phased completeness-driven audit refreshes the corpus without firehose-prompting.

## What

A portable pattern: a scanner first measures completeness/staleness across a long-lived context corpus, then switches into an interview mode that asks one question at a time in priority order (most-decayed section first) instead of dumping a 30-question form. The abstraction — scanner → mode-switch → phased one-question-at-a-time priority — generalizes beyond any specific context schema.
