# Global port-registry CLI for parallel agents on the same machine

> Problem solved: When 4-6 agents run dev servers in parallel worktrees, agent B happily kills agent A's process to reclaim:3000; a shared registry hands out unique ports per project so they stop fighting.

## What

Install `port-registry` (`brew install n3r/tap/port-registry`), then `portctl skill install` to register it as a Claude/Codex skill. Each agent asks the registry for a free port keyed to its project/worktree; the registry tracks assignments globally. Works for both Claude Code and Codex out of the box.
