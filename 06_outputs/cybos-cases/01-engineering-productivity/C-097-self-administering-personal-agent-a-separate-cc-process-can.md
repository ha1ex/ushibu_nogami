# Self-administering personal agent — a separate CC process can repair the bot it lives with

> Problem solved: Long-running personal agents (Telegram bots, daemons) periodically wedge themselves — compaction failures, dead heartbeats, broken sessions — and need a hands-on operator to restart them.

## What

On the same VM where the bot runs, install Claude Code as a separate user/process. When the primary bot detects it's broken (or via watchdog), it shells out to `claude -p "investigate and fix yourself"` and the second CC process diagnoses + repairs the first. Self-administering pattern; converts "page the operator" into "page the meta-agent."
