# Rotate multiple $20 Claude Pro accounts instead of buying Max

## What

Use `cc-account-switcher` (or its Alfred-workflow wrapper) to swap Claude Code credentials between multiple Pro accounts. When one hits limits, trigger the switch; CC opens with the next account's session. Caveat: the VS Code plugin integration is brittle — works cleanest in CLI.
