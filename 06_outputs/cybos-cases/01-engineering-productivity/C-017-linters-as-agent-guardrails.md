# Linters as agent guardrails

> Iterations are wasted on lint-class errors the agent then has to fix. Add "use a linter" to the kickoff prompt; auto-fix on every edit.

## What

Add "use a linter" to the kickoff prompt. The agent sets up linting up front; subsequent edits auto-fix simple errors and fewer iterations are spent on lint-class mistakes.
