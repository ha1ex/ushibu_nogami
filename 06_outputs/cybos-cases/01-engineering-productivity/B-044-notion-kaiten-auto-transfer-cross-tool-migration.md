# Notion → Kaiten auto-transfer (cross-tool migration)

> PMs spend 30 minutes per epic copying spec into ticket fields. Auto-sync removes the entry tax and the dual-source-of-truth trap.

## What

Auto-syncs Notion-formatted spec docs into a Kaiten (or Jira/Linear/etc.) task tracker, pre-populating fields (title, description, parent, owner, labels, estimate) from the spec. The reverse direction is also supported for status updates.

## Why it matters

PMs save ~30 minutes per epic of manual data entry. At a busy PM scale this is ~4 days per backlog cycle. More importantly it removes the "we'll do the cross-system sync next week" trap that leaves two sources of truth out of agreement.

## End-to-end

1. Decide one direction is source of truth — typically the doc tool for specs, the tracker for status.
2. Skill `notion-to-tracker` watches a Notion database/page. On change it reads the page, extracts fields via a structured prompt against the team's schema, upserts the tracker ticket.
3. Skill `tracker-to-notion` writes back status, assignee, due date.
4. Add idempotency via a stable external ID (Notion page UUID stored as a tracker field, or vice versa).
5. Log every sync to a `sync-log.md` for auditability.
6. Dashboard the sync drift weekly; investigate divergences.

## Gotchas

- Never sync both ways without conflict rules. If both sides edited since last sync, queue for human review.
- Don't sync everything — pick the 3–5 fields that matter. Full-field sync produces noise and accidentally overwrites cleanup.

## Tools

- Notion API token + tracker API token
- A field-mapping spec
- Scheduled runner
