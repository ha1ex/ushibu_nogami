# Workspace SSO for company-internal dashboards

> A vibe-coded internal dashboard is public-by-default and unsafe to share. "Add Google Workspace SSO, domain X only" — agent wires it.

## What

For any internal dashboard: tell the agent "Add auth via Google Workspace OAuth. Only emails in domain X allowed." Agent wires it; Vercel auto-provisions. Turns a vibe-coded prototype into something safe to share inside the company.
