# Move vibe-coding repos out of iCloud Drive

> Problem solved: High-velocity agent-driven coding produces file changes faster than iCloud can sync; stale files get pushed to git and break the working tree.

## What

Move every vibe-coding repo out of `~/Library/Mobile Documents/...` into a plain local folder before turning agents loose. Operator hit this after iCloud desynced an in-flight session and committed yesterday's version of a file.
