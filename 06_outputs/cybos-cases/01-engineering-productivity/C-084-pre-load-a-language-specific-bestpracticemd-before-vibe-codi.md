# Pre-load a language-specific `BESTPRACTICE.md` before vibe-coding niche languages

> Problem solved: Coding agents produce mediocre first-shot output in less-mainstream languages (anything outside the top tier of training-data coverage); a pre-loaded best-practices doc lifts first-pass quality dramatically.

## What

Run a deep-research pass on "best practices for <language>, including competitive-programming idioms", save the result as `BESTPRACTICE.md` at repo root, and let Claude/Codex read it before writing any code. One operator reported "first-shot output is immediately good" after adding this step.
