# Database for vibe-coded dashboard (Railway / Supabase)

> Persistent data for a weekend dashboard turns into self-hosted Postgres. Two defaults (Railway paid, Supabase free) skip the infra rabbit hole.

## What

When a vibe-coded dashboard needs persistent data, default to one of two: Railway-hosted Postgres (paid, polished, cron + scheduler bundled) or Supabase (free tier, Google OAuth out of the box). Skip self-hosting.
