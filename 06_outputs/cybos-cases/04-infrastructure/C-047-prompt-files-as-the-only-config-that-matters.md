# Prompt files as the only "config that matters"

> Classifier prompts buried in Python need a deploy to iterate. Move to prompts/*.txt and an inline /context editor; iterate daily without a deploy.

## What

L1/L2/L3 classifier logic lives in `prompts/*.txt`, not in Python. The internal dashboard's `/context` page edits prompts inline so non-engineers can iterate on the classifier without a deploy. Separates prompt-iteration cadence (daily) from code-deploy cadence (weekly).
