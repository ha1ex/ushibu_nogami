# SQLite as shared bus (single DB for all state)

> Small teams default to Postgres + Redis + Kafka before they have 100 users. One SQLite file in WAL mode handles cron + web app + bots concurrently.

## What

A single SQLite file holds all state, history, attempts, action items, CRM rows. No Postgres, no Redis, no queue. WAL mode handles concurrency between cron jobs, a web app, and Telegram bots reading/writing simultaneously. Implication: a 30-person startup should not start with Kafka.
