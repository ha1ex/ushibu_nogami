# Embedded RAG-style chatbot over a consulting deliverable

> A static HTML deliverable can't answer follow-up questions. Embed an MD_CHUNKS array + chat widget; one-off becomes queryable.

## What

A diagnostic dashboard ships its own RAG "ask anything" chatbot embedded directly in the HTML as `` + an MD_CHUNKS array (chunks of the source diagnostic markdown indexed for retrieval, plus a small chat UI overlay). Turns a static deliverable into a queryable artifact.
