# Per-user state via `user_email` column

> Multi-user vibe-coded tools spawn per-tenant DBs and auth gymnastics. One user_email column on every table; works fine at sub-1000-user scale.

## What

Per-user CRM rows, per-user API keys, per-user sender identity, per-user swipe state — all via a `user_email` column on every relevant table. No per-tenant database carve-out, no auth gymnastics. Works at sub-1000-user scale.
