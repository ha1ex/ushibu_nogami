# PII-aware client-data anonymisation

> Regulated industries can't send raw HR/client data to cloud LLMs. Deterministic anonymisation pre-flight; never rely on the model to redact.

## What

Pipeline that anonymises HR / client data before sending it to external models — required for any regulated industry workflow under data residency regulation. Treats anonymisation as a deterministic pre-flight stage, not a model-level guarantee.
