# Performance marketing copilot + commercial-proposal (KP) generator

> $1M ad budgets get spent on creative the team can't analyse by Friday. Copilot answers ad-hoc questions; KP generator writes proposals tailored to the customer.

## What

Two related sales-content tools that share the same underlying customer + product context. (a) A media-buying assistant for performance-marketing teams that connects to ad accounts (Google, Meta) + the company data warehouse + LTV models, answers ad-hoc questions ("which creative performed best with the iOS segment last week?"), and generates weekly portfolio analyses (red/yellow/green by campaign). (b) A KP / commercial-proposal generator that produces tailored proposals from product context + customer profile — the #1 validated sales pain at a large fintech.

## Why it matters

On a $1M/month ad budget, a 20% efficiency improvement is $200K/month — the ROI conversation is trivial. The commercial-proposal generator has a validated revenue ceiling of ~$0.9–3.5M/year at a single mid-market fintech.

## End-to-end

1. Connect agent to ad platforms (Google Ads API, Meta Ads API) + the data warehouse + attribution layer.
2. Phase 1 — chat: sales / marketing team asks ad-hoc questions; agent returns insights with citations to the underlying data.
3. Phase 2 — scheduled workflows: agent runs nightly, replaces the dashboard scan in weekly planning meetings.
4. KP generator: customer profile + product context + win-loss history → tailored proposal draft using the company's voice doc and approved offer matrix.
5. Phase 3 — convert recurring insights into deterministic rules ("kill creative if CPC > $X for 3 days AND CTR < Y") that run on a schedule, autopilot or approval mode.
6. Pricing/packaging note (when this is sold externally): copilot $5–15K/mo; outsourced service tier on success-based pricing.

## Gotchas

- Customer-segment resistance is asymmetric: CMOs and VPs of growth are enthusiastic; the media buyers themselves often resist ("we want to be left alone"). Plan the rollout around department heads, not the ICs.

## Tools

- Ad-platform APIs, data warehouse, LTV / attribution model
- Voice-doc + approved-offer matrix (same artifacts used in #5)
