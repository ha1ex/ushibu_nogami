# Twitter → LinkedIn matching via LLM disambiguation over Harmonic

> Same X handle matches three Harmonic profiles. Two-call disambiguation grounded in the returned candidate IDs stops the model inventing a name.

## What

Given an X handle, a Haiku call extracts company signals, fetches a candidate set from Harmonic, and a second Haiku call disambiguates the correct (company, person) pair — but only against the actual returned candidate IDs, which prevents the second call from hallucinating a name not in the set.
