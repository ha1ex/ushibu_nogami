# Build a Slack data analyst bot with Claude Managed Agents

## Introduction

You'll wrap the agent from [`data_analyst_agent.ipynb`](data_analyst_agent.ipynb) in a Slack bot built with [Bolt for Python](https://docs.slack.dev/tools/bolt-python/), Slack's official framework for building apps. Mention the bot with a question and a CSV attachment to get a narrative report posted back to the thread. Follow-up messages continue the same session.

```text
user: @databot what's driving Q1 revenue?  [sales.csv]
    │
    ▼
bot uploads the CSV and starts an agent session
    │
    ▼
bot streams the agent's progress back to the thread
    │
    ▼
bot posts the finished report to the thread
```

### What you'll learn

- Kick off an agent run from a Slack mention
- Show the agent's progress as thread updates
- Post the finished report back to the thread
- Keep the conversation going with follow-up replies

### Prerequisites

1. Run the install cell below.

2. Create a [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps): choose **Create New App → From a manifest**, paste [`slack_app_manifest.yaml`](example_data/slack_data_bot/slack_app_manifest.yaml), and install it to your workspace. The manifest enables Socket Mode (Slack delivers events over a WebSocket, so you don't need a public URL) and the required scopes. Then grab two tokens:

   - **OAuth & Permissions** → copy the Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-...`)
   - **Basic Information → App-Level Tokens** → generate one with scope `connections:write` (`xapp-...`)

   In a channel you want the bot in, run `/invite @databot`.

3. Run [`data_analyst_agent.ipynb`](data_analyst_agent.ipynb), which saves `ANALYST_ENV_ID`, `ANALYST_AGENT_ID`, and `ANALYST_AGENT_VERSION` to `.env`.

The setup cell below prompts for your Slack tokens and saves them to `.env` so you don't re-enter them on restart (or add them to `.env` beforehand to skip the prompt). `.env` is already in `.gitignore` – never commit it to version control. If you don't have a Slack workspace handy you can still read through the code – each section explains what it does – but you'll need one to run the bot.

```python
%%capture
%pip install -q "anthropic>=0.91.0" python-dotenv slack_bolt requests markdown-to-mrkdwn
```

```python
import io
import os
import threading
from getpass import getpass

import requests
from anthropic import Anthropic
from dotenv import load_dotenv, set_key
from markdown_to_mrkdwn import SlackMarkdownConverter
from slack_bolt import App
from slack_bolt.adapter.socket_mode import SocketModeHandler

load_dotenv(override=True)

# Prompt for Slack tokens on first run and save them to .env.
for key in ("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN", "SLACK_APP_TOKEN"):
    if not os.environ.get(key):
        os.environ[key] = getpass(f"{key}: ")
        set_key(".env", key, os.environ[key])

client = Anthropic()
app = App(token=os.environ["SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"])

for key in ("ANALYST_ENV_ID", "ANALYST_AGENT_ID", "ANALYST_AGENT_VERSION"):
    if not os.environ.get(key):
        raise RuntimeError(f"{key} not set. Run data_analyst_agent.ipynb first.")

# Set these from the IDs saved by the data analyst notebook. Reusing
# the agent and environment avoids re-provisioning on every bot restart.
ANALYST_AGENT = {
    "id": os.environ["ANALYST_AGENT_ID"],
    "version": int(os.environ["ANALYST_AGENT_VERSION"]),
}
ANALYST_ENV_ID = os.environ["ANALYST_ENV_ID"]

# thread_ts -> session_id, so follow-ups land in the same session.
# Sessions stay open for replies. In production, persist this and
# archive sessions when threads go stale.
thread_sessions: dict[str, str] = {}

mrkdwn = SlackMarkdownConverter()
```

## 1. Start a session when the bot is mentioned

Bolt passes an `ack` callback into every handler; calling it tells Slack the event was received. Slack retries anything not acknowledged [within three seconds](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api/#responding), so `on_mention` calls `ack()` immediately and hands the slow work (file upload, session creation, streaming) to `start_analysis` on a background thread.

Each mention creates a session you can open in the [Console](https://platform.claude.com/) under **Sessions** to watch the full trace.

```python
@app.event("app_mention")
def on_mention(event, say, ack):
    ack()
    channel = event["channel"]
    thread_ts = event.get("thread_ts") or event["ts"]
    # Mention text arrives as "<@BOTID> question"; drop the mention prefix.
    question = event["text"].split(">", 1)[-1].strip()
    slack_file = (event.get("files") or [None])[0]

    say(text="On it. Analyzing now.", thread_ts=thread_ts)
    # Run the slow work in a background thread so this handler
    # returns within Slack's 3s limit.
    threading.Thread(target=start_analysis, args=(channel, thread_ts, question, slack_file)).start()


def start_analysis(channel: str, thread_ts: str, question: str, slack_file: dict | None) -> None:
    try:
        # If the mention had a file attached, pull it from Slack and
        # re-upload to the Anthropic Files API so the session can mount it.
        resources = []
        if slack_file:
            resp = requests.get(
                slack_file["url_private"],
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {app.client.token}"},
                timeout=30,
            )
            resp.raise_for_status()
            mime = slack_file.get("mimetype", "text/csv")
            uploaded = client.beta.files.upload(
                file=(slack_file["name"], io.BytesIO(resp.content), mime)
            )
            mount = "/mnt/session/uploads/data.csv"
            resources.append({"type": "file", "file_id": uploaded.id, "mount_path": mount})
            question += f"\n\nThe data is mounted at {mount}."

        # One session per Slack thread. Store the thread coordinates in
        # metadata so anyone reading the event stream knows where to reply.
        session = client.beta.sessions.create(
            environment_id=ANALYST_ENV_ID,
            agent={"type": "agent", **ANALYST_AGENT},
            resources=resources,
            # Titles are capped at 80 chars and can't contain Unicode
            # control/format characters (Slack sometimes inserts them).
            title="".join(c for c in question if c.isprintable())[:80],
            metadata={"slack_channel": channel, "slack_thread_ts": thread_ts},
        )
        thread_sessions[thread_ts] = session.id

        # Send the question as a user.message event. The agent starts
        # working immediately; relay_stream posts its progress to the thread.
        client.beta.sessions.events.send(
            session.id,
            events=[{"type": "user.message", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": question}]}],
        )
        relay_stream(session.id, channel, thread_ts)
    except Exception as e:
        app.client.chat_postMessage(
            channel=channel, thread_ts=thread_ts, text=f"Analysis failed: {type(e).__name__}: {e}"
        )
```

## 2. Relay progress and results to the thread

The `relay_stream` function defined below is the bridge between the two APIs: it reads from the Anthropic session event stream and posts to Slack. It loops until the agent goes idle, then posts the final summary and uploads any files the agent wrote.

`files.list(scope_id=...)` returns every file in the session – both the CSV we uploaded and anything the agent wrote. We filter to `downloadable == True` so only agent-generated outputs (the report, charts) get posted back to Slack, not the user's own input.

```python
def relay_stream(session_id: str, channel: str, thread_ts: str) -> None:
    summary = ""
    posted_progress = False
    for ev in client.beta.sessions.events.stream(session_id):
        t = ev.type
        if t == "agent.message":
            # Keep the latest text block; it becomes the final summary.
            for b in ev.content:
                if b.type == "text" and b.text.strip():
                    summary = b.text
        elif t == "agent.tool_use" and not posted_progress:
            # Post a one-time progress update when the agent starts
            # running commands.
            app.client.chat_postMessage(
                channel=channel, thread_ts=thread_ts, text="Running analysis..."
            )
            posted_progress = True
        elif t == "session.status_idle":
            break
        elif t == "session.status_terminated":
            trace = f"https://platform.claude.com/sessions/{session_id}"
            app.client.chat_postMessage(
                channel=channel,
                thread_ts=thread_ts,
                text=f"Session terminated unexpectedly. Trace: {trace}",
            )
            return

    # Turn is done. Post the summary, then upload any generated files.
    if summary:
        text = mrkdwn.convert(summary)
        if len(text) > 3900:  # Slack text limit ~4000 chars
            text = text[:3900] + "\n_(truncated)_"
        app.client.chat_postMessage(channel=channel, thread_ts=thread_ts, text=text)
    outputs = client.beta.files.list(scope_id=session_id, betas=["managed-agents-2026-04-01"])
    for f in outputs.data:
        if not f.downloadable:
            continue
        content = client.beta.files.download(f.id).read()
        app.client.files_upload_v2(
            channel=channel, thread_ts=thread_ts, filename=f.filename, content=content
        )
```

## 3. Handle follow-ups in the same session

A reply in the thread becomes another turn in the existing session – you don't need to `@mention` the bot again. The container filesystem and conversation history persist across turns.

```python
def continue_session(session_id: str, channel: str, thread_ts: str, text: str) -> None:
    try:
        client.beta.sessions.events.send(
            session_id,
            events=[{"type": "user.message", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": text}]}],
        )
        relay_stream(session_id, channel, thread_ts)
    except Exception as e:
        app.client.chat_postMessage(
            channel=channel, thread_ts=thread_ts, text=f"Analysis failed: {type(e).__name__}: {e}"
        )


@app.event("message")
def on_thread_reply(event, ack):
    ack()
    thread_ts = event.get("thread_ts")
    # Only handle human replies in a thread where we already started
    # a session. Skip edits/deletes and other message subtypes.
    if event.get("subtype"):
        return
    if not thread_ts or event.get("bot_id") or thread_ts not in thread_sessions:
        return
    threading.Thread(
        target=continue_session,
        args=(thread_sessions[thread_ts], event["channel"], thread_ts, event["text"]),
    ).start()
```

## 4. Run the bot

The cell below connects to Slack and starts listening. It blocks while the bot runs – stop it with the ■ interrupt button when you're done.

In any channel the bot is in, mention it with a CSV attached. It posts progress, then the summary and `report.html` in the thread:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/main/managed_agents/example_data/slack_data_bot/slack_thread.png" alt="Slack thread showing the bot's analysis" width="600" />

Reply in-thread to go deeper on the same data.

```python
SocketModeHandler(app, os.environ["SLACK_APP_TOKEN"]).start()
```

## Next steps

You've wrapped the analyst agent in a Slack bot: mentions start a session, the event stream relays progress to the thread, outputs get uploaded, and replies continue the same conversation.

- Swap the agent's system prompt in [`data_analyst_agent.ipynb`](data_analyst_agent.ipynb) to change its analysis style. Re-running that notebook creates a new agent and saves its ID to `.env` for the bot to pick up.
- Persist `thread_sessions` to a database so conversations survive bot restarts.
- Move the bot out of this notebook: copy the code to a `.py` file and deploy it anywhere that can hold a long-lived WebSocket connection.
